/**
 * The Custom Schema type is a way for Snyk to understand your company’s container image tag versioning scheme, enabling Snyk to give more accurate base image upgrade recommendations.  This schema type is essentially a regular expression that groups the different parts of an image’s tag into comparable sections.  If your container image\'s tags follow a versioning scheme other than Semantic Versioning (SemVer),  it is highly recommended that you select the \"Custom Versioning\" schema for your image repositories.
