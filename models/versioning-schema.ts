/**
 * The versioning scheme used by images in the repository.  A versioning schema is a system for identifying and organizing different versions of a project.  It is used to track changes and updates to the project over time, and to help users identify which version they are using.  A versioning schema typically consists of a series of numbers or labels that are incremented to reflect the progression of versions.  For example, a versioning schema might use a series of numbers, such as \"1.0\", \"1.1\", \"2.0\", and so on, to indicate major and minor releases of a product.  A consistent and well-defined versioning schema helps users and tools understand and track the development of a project.
